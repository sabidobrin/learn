/* If you were designing a web crawler, how would you avoid getting into infinite loops? */

/*
What skillset is this testing for? There are two angles for this question. One angle is, can you design a system to solve a business problem? You’re breaking down a problem into small pieces, like how to follow steps to solve problems, how to build a system with various components in it, which is how we solve real-life applications.
Is this a good interview question? For this one, you’re not generally expecting to ask a question that the candidate is hearing for the first time. We want something they already know — they should probably know the answer. We want to have a discussion about, what are the various ways to solve this problem? What are the best practices? Because it will tell us how much they’ve been learning, and it shows how they learn new things and keep up to date with what’s going on.
