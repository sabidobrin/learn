/* What’s the runtime (BigO) of the following code? */

/*
What skillset is this testing for? Another common term that’s used is “algorithmic complexity.” The question could be: “If I’m going to give someone a block of code, can you tell me what are the worst-case scenarios that I have to consider?” Because that’s what BigO and algorithmic complexity really mean.
That’s kind of a cue to the interviewee to think about, “What are some of the worst-case or edge-case scenarios that I have to be aware of?” And that’s important, because those things, while they account for maybe one or two percent of the number of inputs, they’re the kinds of things that often will crash our programs.
Is this a good interview question? As software developers, we all have a tendency, when given a problem, to immediately jump into all of the “what ifs” and the edge cases that we have to worry about — especially after we’ve been kind of burned a couple times. We do tend to try and problem solve and prevent those worst-case scenarios.
Being able to ask in plain English, “What is this code doing and what’s the worst-case scenario?” is an easier way to communicate than to recall the difference between BigO(n) or linear or logarithmic or n2 or exponential time, because then you’re counting on someone having been exposed, again, to that type of formal education that covered that content.
