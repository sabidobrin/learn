/* Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. */

What skillset is this testing for? Once you see the solution, it can be very easy to figure out — however, getting to that solution is often a struggle for most people. Because you have to think not only about where you’re at, but the next value in that Roman numeral. So, for example, four is “IV.” And so you can’t just go, “‘I,’ that’s one, ‘V,’ that’s five — boom, we’re at six!” Actually, you’re at four. So how do you differentiate between adding and subtracting not only looking at where you’re at but where you’re going? So it’s kind of got those two different pieces there.
Is this a good interview question? It depends on the knowledge of the interviewee going into the question here. I make the assumption that most of the time people know Roman numerals, and that can be an incorrect assumption, because not everyone actually knows or understands Roman numerals. So if you are coming into it not even knowing Roman numerals, it’s a challenging one. In general, I would say you’re not at that much more of a disadvantage, as long as you’re upfront and honest, like, “Hey, I’ve never worked with Roman numerals before.”
