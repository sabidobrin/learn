/* Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that one. */

/*
What skillset is this testing for? Not every interview candidate who gets selected actually solves a problem. That actually doesn’t matter that much. Because in the real world, a single individual does not know the answers to everything they’re trying to solve. You are going to only succeed when you’re able to collaborate with others, get others feedback and act on that. When you get stuck, what do you do? If someone is giving you a hint, are you responding well to the hint? That means you’re probably great at collaborating later on when you come here.
Is this a good interview question? At Chainalysis, we’re about cryptocurrency. In an interview, if we ask about that — because that’s what we do on a day-by-day basis — most people would fail, because no one really knows about cryptocurrencies. 
So what you do is, you use the most abstract way of asking about those things without mentioning the topics, which are domain specific. If you abstract the domain knowledge out of it, you will come down to a basic problem like this. So that’s what this is. It’s actually making the hiring bar common across all candidates with different domain experiences. This is a good equalizer.
