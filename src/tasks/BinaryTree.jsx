What skillset is this testing for? A lot of people will bring up trees when they talk about database structure and design — it’s not like tables and keys, it’s more like underlying indexes and how those get managed. You’re getting into the realm of a database administrator, or a database developer who’s very specialized into fine-tuning databases.
If I had a student encounter this problem, I’d encourage them to work with the interviewer, rather than just giving up. They might want to basically go down into the level of how they would structure this problem in their code. They might talk about classes that they might use or various other data collections that they’ve worked with and explain how they might solve the problem.
Is this a good interview question? Someone who’s entering into a junior position often lacks prior experience professionally, where they can stand out and say, “Here is what I’m capable of doing.” And so we sometimes default to these questions to demonstrate that candidates have a foundational understanding? Unfortunately, these questions assume that one has had a foundational computer science education.
There are other ways to measure that. Have them either speak through a project that they specifically worked on, or give them some code and ask them to explain it to you, because that gets at their communication capability to explain what code is doing. When they walk through code, do they gloss over a number of things? Or do they get very specific?
