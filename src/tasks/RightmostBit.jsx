/* Given two numbers M and N, find the position of the rightmost different bit in the binary representation of numbers. */

What skillset is this testing for? It’s useful when you are doing work on low-level systems. Because when you’re working at a very low level, you need to understand how things are represented in actual physical memory. Like when you type your name, how is this saved on the disk? How is this saved in memory? That’s all saved in the binary representation of the numbers. If you understand that, you can write the part of code that is actually doing the work to save information in memory in a very proper and efficient way.
Is this a good interview question? There are a lot of things that need low-level stuff. Let’s say you are making an iPhone — not an iPhone app — you’re going very low level at that point. If you understand how to solve this problem, if you can have a discussion around the topic, we can assume that you’re good at low-level stuff. That’s kind of where it’s useful. So this is not super applicable to every company, but it’s useful to companies that do a lot more low-level stuff.
